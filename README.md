# Semi_Autonomous_Robot
 
Semi Autonomous Robot that utilise vision and navigation systems to help costumers get familiar
with the scenes, the robot utilises Line follower algorithms , bar-code and faces vision , ROS communication protocols ,
Raspberry and Arduino MEGA Micro controllers, OpenCV vision

theses files are consistant to the pid and line follower algorithm and serial communication via serial communication protocol and BY using ROS
